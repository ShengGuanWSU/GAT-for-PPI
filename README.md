# GAT-for-PPI
Graph Attention Networks with the code compatible with PPI and Reddit 

I notice that many ones show off their codes for GAT in tf or pytorch while few people implement the part for PPI. It is an important thing to validate this type of powerful GNNs on the large-scale dataset and know its limit, and make a progress. Based on this, I fork GAT in the tf-version and implement this part for others to use or compare.
